# Makers Aceplay Spring Boot & AWS Seed

This is a seed project for the Aceplay Engineering Project.

It comes set up with:

* The JUnit5 test framework.
* The Spring Boot web framework.
* The Spring Security framework & JWT for auth.
* The PostgreSQL database.
* The JPA ORM
* AWS for deployment and file hosting.

Several features are implemented. Your task is to work through the tickets in
the projects tab.

## Getting the project set up

### Stage One: Project & Tests

Open this directory using [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). You may
need to wait for the dependencies to install.

Then, in the Gradle sidebar:

* To run the tests: `Aceplay -> Tasks -> Verification -> Test`

If you encounter any problems, they are not intended. Contact your coach for
advice.

### Stage Two: Development Server

You'll need two important files from your coach to put into `config/`. 
Get those.

Then create the development database:

```shell
$ createdb makers-aceplay-dev
$ # You'll see nothing if it worked
```

Finally, to run the server, open the Gradle sidebar and run `Aceplay -> Tasks ->
Application -> bootRun`.

When the server has started successfully, you'll be able to visit 
`http://localhost:8080/` and see the application running.

If you need a test music file, you can find one in
[docs/test_music.mp3](docs/test_music.mp3).

## Documentation

This application is partially documented. Some documentation is more extensive
than you would find in the real world, and some areas leave room for you to
discover.

There are links most files of the code to video walkthroughs of that particular
file.

There is a full playlist of all of the video resources
[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpm7HyVZ61CHFjkDWHLDJgzZCBTpXNIO),
though we would recommend using them only they become useful in the project.
